# Real-time-Sign-Language-Recognition-Using-OpenCV-and-Deep-Learning
Employed OpenCV for video processing and hand-detection in real-time. Utilized Keras with TensorFlow backend to train a deep learning model for sign language classification on a dataset of 2900 300x300 images. This model offers instantaneous, precise sign language recognition.
